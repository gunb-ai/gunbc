# v4 — Design Decisions Ledger

The single record of v4's design ratifications. Two states:

- **RATIFIED** — operator-decided and binding. Encoded in the cited file(s).
  This ledger is just the index; the file headers are authority.
- **PROPOSED** — a recommended resolution awaiting your ratify-or-redirect.
  Nothing here is decided unilaterally. The recommendation is my read,
  with the tradeoff stated honestly so you can overrule it cheaply.

How to use this PR: ratify or redirect each PROPOSED item (review comment
or merge-with-notes). On ratification, each item is encoded into the
cited file headers — the same flow the RATIFIED items already went
through — and moves to Part 1.

## Part 1 — RATIFIED (this session, 2026-05-15)

| ID | Decision | Encoded in |
|----|----------|-----------|
| **A1** | One recursive type (Node); 6 connectives + 5 behaviors are orthogonal flat-discriminant axes; behaviors structural not lens-derived; recursive generics are Node-underlying (Instantiation + name-ref); regular recursion admissible, non-regular polymorphic recursion a STOP absent a decidable bound | `std/node.dag` header |
| **A2** | Termination is Tier-1; `Loop` = bounded recursion total-by-construction; descent evidence implicit-on-sub-Node or explicit ranking; checker not discoverer; the bound IS the cost-lens datum; residual boundary stated | `std/node.dag` header |
| **A3** | Retirement = a reproduction predicate, not a count; it is an early-surfacing amplifier, NOT un-gameable (Trusting-Trust); seed trust is a named axiom; culture + operator-ratification is the actual enforcement | `STRUCTURE.md` §7, `workflow/bootstrap.dag`, `TASKS.md` T-5/T-15 |
| **A4** | Folded into A3 — a 7th connective is the same machine: deviation changes the reproduction → conspicuous signal → STOP. Not "the substrate refuses by construction" | `STRUCTURE.md` §7, `workflow/bootstrap.dag` |
| **U1** | One homomorphism-with-cost carrier; the back half is five phases (Find/Realize/Measure/Compare) not five engines; no-engine discipline (empty search → helpful Diagnostic, never fabrication) | `std/algebra.dag` header |
| **C2** | Synthesis = compare(derived cost, the relation's structurally-derived lower bound) via a closed `LowerBoundTechnique` set; NOT a (naive→better) rule library; honest worked examples preserved | `lens/synthesis.dag`, `TASKS.md` T-17 |
| **U2** | `complexity.dag` *consumes* `cost.dag`'s `SymbolicCost`, never re-derives; **cost is TOTAL over the closed kernel** — no per-feature opt-in, so a future addition cannot bypass cost (the no-eternal-maintenance property) | `lens/cost.dag` + `lens/complexity.dag` headers |
| **C3** | `normalize` dissolves exactly the 4 bounded sugar forms (`service/fn/type/operation`) into Node; not identity, not open-ended; new sugar = STOP | `compiler/03_normalize.dag` + `TASKS.md` T-8 |
| **C1** | `infer` is the bounded *Find* phase — bounded structural unification over the finite (A1/A2) space; empty ⇒ Diagnostic, never fabricated coercion | `compiler/04_infer.dag` header |
| **B3** | The type signature is the single effect authority; the effect lens reads it; coordination effect-types are carriers over it, not a parallel taxonomy | `lens/effect.dag` + `extdeps/coordination.dag` |
| **C4** | On-disk emitted artifacts (`ci.yml`, trampoline) are committed==emit(source) checked projections, not editable authority (same machine as A3) | `workflow/ci.dag` + `STRUCTURE.md` + `workflow/bootstrap.dag` |
| **C5** | Ingest = emit⁻¹ on each model's lossless core; outside ⇒ fail-closed Diagnostic. Guaranteed ASAP via testgen `bidirectional_roundtrip` (Phase-1.5, gated per-PR via the B1 hash from first language-model commit) | `extdeps/languages/*` + `lens/testgen.dag` + C5 note |
| **K-1** | Kernel identifiers are OPAQUE `Symbol`s (equality only, no content accessor); spelling lives in a boundary table, never kernel/lens-readable — structurally forecloses the v2 string-heuristic channel | `std/node.dag` header (T-1 worker encodes) |
| **IR-1** | `InferredTree` is NOT a new type — it is `Node` + a FROZEN flat `InferredFacts` coordinate (resolved_type, inhabits, cost, descent); **cardinality and effects are NOT fields** — both already carried by `resolved_type`'s Node structure (the Cardinality connective / the signature), caching = second authority P2; a 5th field is a STOP; modeled up front, not emergent | `compiler/04_infer.dag` header |
| **B2-OMNI** | parse is one ingestion instance; `ingest`/`emit` are parameterized boundaries over declarative LanguageModels; Node is the universal pivot ⇒ O(N+M) not O(N×M); `.dag` is language #1, never hardcoded | `compiler/00_compile.dag` + `01_tokenize`/`02_parse`/`05_emit` headers |
| **L-1** | Verilog/SPICE/English added as **parallel B2-OMNI falsification probes** (T-4.9/4.10/4.11), maximally diverse on purpose. Forks resolved: English = boundary-honesty probe (Shape B emit + fail-closed ingest TestClaim), **not** a language model; SPICE = `extdeps/formats/` (netlist is a data format); Verilog = the IN-B concurrency validation (a needed 6th behavior = C1 escalation, by design caught early) | `TASKS.md` T-4.9/4.10/4.11 + `extdeps/languages/verilog.dag`, `extdeps/formats/spice.dag`, `test/claim/boundary/english_ingest_fail_closed.dag` |
| **B1** | One content-addressing scheme: a `std`-level Merkle catamorphism `content_hash : Node -> Hash` over the **canonical-form clause** (a SEPARATE explicit node.dag authority — NOT subsumed by A1, which only covers recursion/axis-closure/generics/termination). `Hash` is an opaque digest (no content accessor, K-1-style). One scheme consumed by T-15/T-20/T-21 + A3 + C5. NOT workflow-level | `std/primitive.dag` (`Hash`); `std/node.dag` (canonical-form clause + `content_hash` fold — T-1 worker encodes per relay) |

## Part 2 — RATIFIED 2026-05-15 (cascade-closures — now in Part 1)

> **All three (U2, C3, C1) were ratified and are encoded — see Part 1.**
> The detailed rationale is retained below as the decision record.

> (no per-feature opt-in); that is the no-eternal-maintenance property.

These are not new decisions — they are the logical closure of a RATIFIED
parent. Each is confirm-or-redirect, not a fresh fork.

### U2 — `cost.dag` and `complexity.dag` are two projections, not two engines

- **Why (cascade of U1):** "coercion cost = complexity" + the one-carrier
  rule mean these cannot be independent engines.
- **Recommended:** `complexity.dag` *consumes* `cost.dag`'s `SymbolicCost`
  and projects it to an asymptotic `ComplexityBound`; it never
  independently re-derives cost. Plus: verify the `SymbolicCost` lattice
  axioms at T-12 ratification (`UnknownCost`-as-top must satisfy the
  lattice laws — the `AbelianGroup<Nat>` precedent).
- **Tradeoff:** none of consequence; the alternative (two cost
  derivations) is the parallel-authority bug U1 forbids.
- **Encodes into:** `lens/cost.dag` + `lens/complexity.dag` headers
  (the consume-not-re-derive contract).

### C3 — `normalize` (T-8) dissolves exactly the 4 bounded sugar forms

- **Why (cascade of A1):** THESIS confirms `service / fn / type /
  operation` are the bounded surface sugar over the substrate.
- **Recommended:** `03_normalize.dag` dissolves exactly those 4 sugar
  forms into Node trees. It is **not** identity and **not** open-ended.
  Any new sugar form is a substrate extension = STOP.
- **Tradeoff:** none; this closes the "what does normalize do in a
  no-sugar language" tension — there *is* bounded sugar, exactly 4.
- **Encodes into:** `compiler/03_normalize.dag` header + `TASKS.md` T-8.

### C1 — T-9 infer is the bounded *Find* phase of the one homomorphism

- **Why (cascade of A1 + A2 + U1):** A1 forbids a separate recursive
  `InferredNode`; A2 makes termination Tier-1; U1 makes infer the *Find*
  phase over the one carrier.
- **Recommended:** the homomorphism search is **bounded structural
  unification** over the (finite, by A1/A2) candidate space — not an
  open search. Empty result ⇒ a helpful Diagnostic (`feedback_no_engine`),
  never a fabricated coercion. The v2 12-file split cannot recur
  (its cause — a separate recursive inferred type — is structurally gone).
- **Tradeoff:** restricts inference to the decidable structural fragment;
  that is the decidability invariant, not a limitation.
- **Encodes into:** `compiler/04_infer.dag` header + `TASKS.md` T-9.

## Part 3 — open forks

> **Status 2026-05-15 — Part 3 CLOSED.** All open forks ratified and
> encoded (see Part 1): B1 (std-level fold — operator confirmed),
> B2→B2-OMNI, B3, B4→IR-1, C4, C5. The per-header encoding pass is
> complete. **THREE** node.dag-contract items the T-1 worker encodes per
> relay (it owns that file): **K-1** (opaque Symbol), the **canonical-form
> clause** (total deterministic normal form — a SEPARATE authority, NOT
> subsumed by A1; B1 depends on it), and **`content_hash`** (the Merkle
> fold over that form). Nothing in Part 3 remains PROPOSED.

### B1 — One content-addressing scheme (ELEVATED: load-bearing for A3)

- **Tension:** T-15 fixed-point hash, T-20 pinned bootstrap binary, T-21
  unchanged-subgraph detection, **and the A3 reproduction/surfacing
  check** all need content-addressing. Three schemes = drift.
- **Recommended:** a single canonical content-hash over the canonical
  Node structure. **Correction (3248138046):** A1 does NOT make Node
  canonical — A1 ratifies recursion / axis-closure / generics /
  termination only. Canonical form is a SEPARATE explicit node.dag
  authority — the **canonical-form clause** — which the T-1 worker
  encodes alongside K-1 and `content_hash`. B1 *depends on* that clause;
  it is not subsumed by A1. The clause must define a total deterministic
  normal form (structural child order; opaque-Symbol identity per K-1; no
  incidental ordering) so the fold is well-defined. Defined **once**,
  consumed by T-15/T-20/T-21 + the A3 check.
- **Tradeoff / settled:** *where it lives* — `std`-level: a pure fold
  over the canonical Node, not `workflow`-level (operator-confirmed).
- **Encodes into:** `std/node.dag` (canonical-form clause) + the chosen
  hash-operation owner header + cross-refs in T-15/T-20/T-21.

### B2 — Grammar is declarative data; the parser is a generic walker

- **Tension:** if grammar is a procedural recognizer, tokenize/parse are
  hand-shaped and gameable.
- **Recommended:** grammar lives as **declarative production data** in
  `extdeps/languages/*.dag` (T-4); `01_tokenize`/`02_parse` (T-6/T-7) are
  **generic Node-tree builders driven by that data**, not per-language
  procedural code. Productions are Node trees (consistent with A1).
- **Tradeoff:** a declarative-grammar substrate is more work to design
  than a hand recognizer, but a hand recognizer is the gameable path and
  re-fragments per language.
- **Encodes into:** `extdeps/languages/*` headers + `01_tokenize.dag` +
  `02_parse.dag` + `TASKS.md` T-6/T-7.

### B3 — The type signature is the single effect authority

- **Tension:** effects appear in three places (the effect lens T-13,
  coordination effect-types T-4.8, `unenumerated_effects.dag`).
- **Recommended:** the **type signature is the one effect authority**.
  The effect lens *reads* effects from the signature; coordination's
  `HttpEffect`/`QueueEffect` are typed carriers *over* that, not a
  parallel effect taxonomy/enum.
- **Tradeoff:** requires coordination's effect-types to be expressed as
  signature facts the lens reads, not a standalone enum — slightly more
  modeling, but it's the single-authority discipline (same class as the
  AssertKind/testgen reconciliation already done).
- **Encodes into:** `lens/effect.dag` + `extdeps/coordination.dag` +
  cross-ref to `test/claim/impossible_bug/unenumerated_effects.dag`.

### B4 — There is no separate IR; "IR" is InferredTree; the seam is T-11

- **Tension:** T-10 emit / T-22 eval / T-11 specialization — where does
  target-specificity enter, and is there an IR type?
- **Recommended:** **no separate IR type** (A1: no new recursive type).
  The "target-agnostic IR" *is* InferredTree (Node + inferred
  discriminant). emit (T-10) and eval (T-22) both consume it;
  target-specificity enters **only** at T-11 per-target realization
  tables (the homomorphism's realization per target, read from
  `extdeps/languages/*`).
- **Tradeoff:** none vs A1 — this is the consistent reading; the
  alternative (a distinct IR type) is the bounded-kernel violation.
- **Encodes into:** `compiler/05_emit.dag` + `compiler/05_eval.dag` +
  `TASKS.md` T-10/T-11/T-22.

### C4 — On-disk emitted artifacts are checked projections, not authority

- **Tension:** `ci.yml` must exist on disk (GitHub reads it) yet
  `feedback_no_generated_code_on_disk` forbids editable generated code.
- **Recommended:** same machine as A3. Emitted artifacts are build-dir
  transient where possible. Where one must be committed (`ci.yml`), the
  committed file is guarded by a **committed == emit(source)**
  reproduction check (the A3 early-surfacing machine): divergence is
  conspicuous and STOP-routed. The `.dag` is authority; the on-disk file
  is a *checked projection*, never editable authority.
- **Tradeoff:** this is the honest reconciliation (no-generated-code =
  "no editable generated *authority*", not "no generated bytes on
  disk"); same shape as A3, so it's a confirm of an already-ratified
  pattern more than a new fork.
- **Encodes into:** `workflow/ci.dag` + `STRUCTURE.md` (the C4 pattern) +
  `workflow/bootstrap.dag` (the trampoline).

### C5 — Ingest is emit's structural inverse on the lossless core only

- **Tension:** the R4 arbitrary-ingestion roundtrip claim needs ingest to
  be `emit⁻¹`, or RoundTrips is hope not construction.
- **Recommended:** ingest and emit are the two directions of **one**
  language-model homomorphism (T-4 direction-agnostic). `RoundTrips`
  holds by construction **on the lossless core**. Outside it (a target
  feature with no Node equivalent), ingest is **partial → a fail-closed
  Diagnostic** (`feedback_no_engine`: can't ingest losslessly ⇒ surface,
  never a lossy guess).
- **Tradeoff:** this *bounds* the arbitrary-ingestion claim honestly
  (lossless core + fail-closed boundary) rather than overclaiming total
  invertibility. That honesty is the point, not a weakness.
- **Encodes into:** `extdeps/languages/*` + `extdeps/formats/*` headers +
  a C5 note in `v4-close-interrogation.md`.

## Part 4 — Lower-cascade (resolve before the owning task; non-blocking)

Recommended defaults; not blocking T-1 or the spine. Confirm in passing
or defer to the task.

- **T-4.6 JSON number model** — recommend **arbitrary-precision by
  default, opt-in IEEE-754** (preserves big-int roundtrip; RoundTrips is
  load-bearing per C5).
- **T-4.7 Server/Client Components** — recommend **effect-typed, not a
  structural distinction** (consistent with B3; SC/CC differ by effect).
- **T-4.8 effect-type-set** — **the question dissolves under B3
  (correction, 3248138059).** B3 made the type signature the *single*
  effect authority; a closed `HttpEffect | QueueEffect | …` enum would be
  exactly the parallel effect taxonomy B3 forbids (P2). So there is NO
  effect-type enum to "close": `HttpEffect`/`QueueEffect` are typed
  CARRIERS read from the signature by `lens/effect.dag`, not an
  enumerated axis. Non-default; resolved by B3.
- **T-18 bounded-coverage** — coverage is over the **finite substrate
  cross-product**; infinite inhabitant domains are sampled by declared
  generators, never enumerated (keeps coverage decidable).
- **T-20 v2-interpreter pre-flight** — **a check, not a decision**: audit
  frozen v2's `run` opcode support against what `bootstrap.dag` needs
  *before* T-20 starts. If v2 can't interpret a needed construct, that's
  a STOP (the seed is frozen — can't grow it).

## Part 5 — Ratification flow

For each PROPOSED item: ratify (👍 / "confirm") or redirect ("instead,
…"). On ratification I encode it into the cited file header(s) — the
same way A1/A2/A3/U1/C2 were encoded — and promote it to Part 1 here.
Quick confirms (Part 2) are cascade-closures of already-ratified
parents; redirecting one means reopening its parent. Part 3 are genuine
forks; B1's "where it lives" is the one pick I most need from you.

Nothing here is encoded into substrate until you ratify it. This file
PROPOSES; it does not decide.
