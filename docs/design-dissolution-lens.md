# Dissolution Lens — design spec

> **Status: design (rework-tracker PR #3240 task B1).** `modeling-discipline.md`
> Practice 10 carries the *rules*; this doc carries the *enforcement
> mechanism* — the checker / lens that makes the rules mechanical. Per
> Practice 10's own scoping: "the enforcement mechanism … is design work,
> specified in the planned `docs/design-dissolution-lens.md`."

A **lens** is a deterministic structural projection over the `.dag`
model — no LLM, no judgment. A finding either matches a lens's structural
signature or it does not. Run as a hard CI gate, a lens catches a finding
*every time*, instead of hoping a reviewer notices.

## 1. The core invariant

Every dissolution finding violates one invariant, in one of two
directions:

> **A1 — Do not hand-roll a derived operation.** If a function's behavior
> is fixed entirely by the shape of a modeled type, it is re-deriving
> something the compiler already derives. *Inverse:* do not nominalize an
> operation as a type — an operation is a function, not a domain
> structure.

A1 is proposed, pending operator ratification (rework-tracker task A1).
Ratifying it makes "this violates A1" a citable hard rule. The lens suite
is how A1 is enforced *mechanically*.

## 2. Two tracks

The lens is not the cure — it is the net.

- **Track 1 — lenses (enforcement).** Catch hand-rolling at CI. This doc.
- **Track 2 — substrate-derivation (the cure).** Make hand-rolling
  *impossible*: the substrate derives an algebraic type's canonical
  operations (variant discriminants, catamorphism) from its declaration,
  so there is nothing left to hand-roll. The burn-down substrate nodes
  (the discriminant-predicate node; `fold_node` / catamorphism nodes)
  are Track 2.

Every dissolution finding is a symptom of one substrate gap: **the
substrate lets you *declare* an algebraic type but does not *derive its
canonical operations*** — so workers hand-roll them. Track 1 holds the
line until Track 2 closes that gap.

## 3. Methodology — how a lens is derived

Every lens in this doc was derived, and every future lens is derived, the
same way:

> **slipped-by issue → core invariant violated → substrate root cause →
> mechanical lens.**

A lens is added from *real evidence* — a finding that reached merge-ready
despite being a defect (§8). The lens's signature is the smallest
structural pattern that catches that finding's class with zero false
positives on the clean shape.

## 4. Layer 0 — standard compiler hygiene

The floor every mainstream compiler (rustc, clang, tsc, the ML family)
enforces. **On by default in every profile** (§7) — Layer 0 is table
stakes, not a strictness dial. Shipping below this is a regression from a
normal compiler. Build-first: Layer 1 composes Layer-0 primitives.

**Group A — Unused / dead**
- **L0.1 Unused variable** — a bound name never read.
- **L0.2 Unused parameter** — a function/lambda parameter never read.
  *(Layer-1 reuse: the constant-algebra check, L1.1, is this applied to a
  fold algebra.)*
- **L0.3 Unused import.**
- **L0.4 Unused declaration** — a `type` / `fn` / `data` constant
  declared but never referenced. *(Layer-1 reuse: the hollow-type lens,
  L1.3, is this + "no inhabitance edge.")*
- **L0.5 Unused field** — a struct field never read.
- **L0.6 Unreachable code** — statements/arms after a diverging point.
- **L0.7 Dead / constant branch** — an `if`/`match` arm a static check
  proves is never reached.

**Group B — Binding integrity**
- **L0.8 Unbound name** — use of an undefined identifier.
- **L0.9 Use-before-definition** — a binding read before assignment.
- **L0.10 Duplicate definition** — a name declared twice in one scope.
- **L0.11 Shadowing** — a binding silently shadowing an outer one.

**Group C — Match / exhaustiveness** *(gunbc has coproducts + `match` —
directly load-bearing)*
- **L0.12 Non-exhaustive match** — a `match` missing a coproduct variant.
  *(Relates to Practice 1, fail-closed: an unhandled variant is a silent
  gap.)*
- **L0.13 Redundant / unreachable arm** — an arm subsumed by an earlier
  one.

**Group D — Result / fact discipline**
- **L0.14 Ignored result** — a produced value, especially a
  diagnostic-carrying `Outcome`, silently dropped. *(This is Practice 3,
  "facts flow forward," made mechanical.)*

**Group E — Control flow**
- **L0.15 Missing return** — a value-typed function with a path that
  yields no value.

Layer 0 is not all new: L0.12 and L0.14 already have gunbc Practice
analogs (Practices 1, 3) — part of Layer 0 is making an existing Practice
a mechanical lens.

## 5. Layer 1 — dissolution lenses

The gunbc-specific modeling-honesty checks. Each: the finding it kills,
its `.dag` signature, decidability, and the escape valve (the legitimate
non-finding).

### L1.1 Discriminant-predicate lens — kills *predicate dissolution*

- *Signature:* a `Bool`-returning `fn` over a coproduct whose body is a
  single `match` with **literal `true`/`false` arms** per variant.
  **Extended (the #3249 lesson):** also a `fold`/`cata` call whose algebra
  is **constant in its recursive/accumulator argument** — a discriminant
  laundered through a fold. (The constant-algebra tell is L0.2,
  unused-parameter, applied to a fold algebra.)
- *Decidable:* fully — name + param type + body shape.
- *Verdict:* hard error on `std/` / substrate / reusable-helper files.
- *Escape:* a `match` whose arms do *computed* work (not literal
  `true`/`false`) is genuinely distinct → clean 🟢.
- *Kills:* `nat_is_zero` (#3255), `free_monoid_non_empty` (#3250),
  `free_monoid_is_empty`-via-fold (#3249), the `float_body_is_nan` /
  `edge_is_named` saturation class.

### L1.2 Degenerate-type lens — kills *nominalization*

- *Signature:* (a) a struct whose **every field is function-typed** with
  **no `data` instance**; (b) **N near-identical single-field structs**.
- *Decidable:* yes — field types, cross-ref for instances, similarity
  scan.
- *Verdict:* hard error on the wrapper shape.
- *Escape:* a genuine algebraic structure — non-function data fields,
  multiple `data` inhabitants (`Monoid`) — does not match.
- *Kills:* #3256's 26 `type ListMap { apply: fn }` wrappers; the
  `{ spelling: String }` ×N degenerate-wrapper class.

### L1.3 Hollow-type lens — kills *hollow declarations* (Practice 8's hollow-alias finding, at the type level)

- *Signature:* a declared type **nothing inhabits** — no `data` instance,
  no `fn` returning it, no alias-identity to a substrate type. (This is
  L0.4, unused-declaration, + "no inhabitance edge.")
- *Decidable:* yes — cross-reference whether anything constructs it.
- *Verdict:* hard error.
- *Escape:* a type that *is* constructed, or aliases a substrate carrier,
  passes.

### L1.4 Carrier-clone lens — kills *carrier dissolution*

- *Signature:* a locally-declared coproduct **structurally isomorphic to
  a `std/` carrier** (`Foo { value: T } | FooRejected { diagnostic }` ≅
  `Outcome<T>`).
- *Decidable:* yes — type-shape match against the `std/` carrier set.
- *Verdict:* hard error.
- *Escape:* a coproduct carrying a payload the std carrier genuinely
  cannot express passes.

### L1.5 Catamorphism lens — kills *walker / traverse dissolution*

- *Signature:* a `fn` recursing over a structural type by `match`ing its
  variants + self-calling on the sub-structure; or a `fold` body that is a
  `match acc { Rejected => propagate ; Ok => continue }` short-circuit
  ladder.
- *Decidable:* on the clean shape — recursion mirrors the data shape.
- *Verdict:* hard error on the clean shape; **reviewer-confirm** on
  genuinely-irregular recursion (call graph ≠ data graph) → clean 🟢.
- *Kills:* `ci.dag`'s hand-rolled `List` combinators (#3213); the
  resolve/normalize walkers (#3225).

### L1.6 Emit/template lens — kills *emit/template dissolution*

- *Signature:* a field or value that is a **template string literal** — a
  string literal carrying positional placeholders (`{0}`, `{1}`, …) used
  as an emitter, where grammar-as-declarative-bidirectional-data belongs.
- *Decidable:* yes — a literal string with interpolation placeholders is a
  structural match (the keystone decidability table already classifies it
  "structural — a literal template-string field").
- *Verdict:* hard error on the literal-template shape.
- *Escape:* a plain string constant with no placeholders, or genuine
  string *data* that is not an emitter template, passes.
- *Kills:* string-templated emitters (`template: "Vec<{0}>"`).

## 6. The discriminant / catamorphism distinction

L1.1 and L1.5 enforce one algebraic fact worth stating directly: a
coproduct has **two distinct derived operations** that must never be
conflated.

- The **discriminant** — "which variant?" — inspects the top constructor.
  Non-recursive, O(1).
- The **catamorphism** — the structural fold. Consumes the whole
  structure, O(n).

`free_monoid_is_empty` is a discriminant; expressing it through
`free_monoid_fold` (a catamorphism) is a category error — O(n) for an
O(1) fact — and *camouflages* the predicate-dissolution finding by moving
the variant-discriminant out of a `match` into fold-algebra arguments,
where the un-extended L1.1 would not see it. Hence L1.1's constant-algebra
extension: **a fold whose algebra ignores its recursive argument is not a
catamorphism — it is a discriminant, and is the same finding.**

## 7. The selective-profile model

A lens is a derived projection — composable and scoped. "Strictness" is
not a global dial; it is a **profile** — a set of lenses assigned to a
scope.

| profile | scope | lenses |
|---|---|---|
| **substrate** (strictest) | `src/v4/std/`, `src/v4/compiler/` | Layer 0 + all of Layer 1, all hard gates |
| **target** | `src/v4/extdeps/`, target models | Layer 0 + Layer 1, but L1.5 reviewer-confirms (target modeling has more legitimately-irregular recursion) |
| **scaffold** | early-milestone code marked `// scaffold:` | Layer 0 only |

Rules:
- **Layer 0 is on in every profile**, scaffold included. "Lens-shaped"
  does not mean "optional"; selectivity governs Layer-1 strictness only.
- **A profile downgrade is never silent and never self-service.** A file
  cannot quietly dial its own lens set down — that turns "selectively
  applied" into "selectively ignored." The `// scaffold:` marker is
  permitted, but it is the *in-file record of a reviewer-approved,
  scope-level decision*, not a worker's self-applied dial: it is
  **ratchet-only** — it may not be added to a file to dodge a lens that
  currently fires. Strict-by-default; loosen only deliberately and
  visibly.
- **Turning Layer 1 off does not turn the *discipline* off.** A
  dissolution finding in scaffold code still carries its 🟡 disposition
  tag with a bound plan — the keystone's universal "every 🟡 binds a
  dissolution plan" mandate is profile-independent. The scaffold profile
  suppresses the *CI hard-error*, never the *modeling obligation*.
  Otherwise `// scaffold:` becomes lens-off + no-tag = invisible debt —
  exactly the escape hatch this section forbids.
- The compiler runs the **substrate** profile on its own
  `src/v4/**/*.dag`. The compiler does not exempt itself from the
  discipline it enforces — that is the example others follow.

## 8. The slipped-by ledger

A living record. Every finding that reaches merge-ready despite a defect
is logged here, root-caused by the §3 methodology — so the lens set grows
from real evidence, not speculation.

| date | PR | finding | core invariant violated | lens |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-18 | #3250 | `free_monoid_non_empty` hand-rolled discriminant | A coproduct's variant-discriminant is a derived operation | L1.1 |
| 2026-05-18 | #3255 | `nat_is_zero` hand-rolled discriminant | same | L1.1 |
| 2026-05-18 | #3256 | 26 combinators nominalized into single-field wrapper types | an operation is a function, not a type | L1.2 |
| 2026-05-18 | #3249 | `free_monoid_is_empty` laundered through a fold | discriminant ≠ catamorphism; do not conflate | L1.1 (extended) |

Pattern across the ledger: all four are burn-down *substrate* PRs — the
lane built to remove dissolution debt produced it. Each was *mostly*
correct with one dissolution defect; #3249's was invisible to reviewers
because the fold-laundering hid it. This is why the lens suite (mechanical,
every time) and the burn-down pre-gate (catch at the source) both exist.

## 9. Build path

1. **Layer 0 first** — a checker over parsed `.dag`, a sibling of the
   `scripts/check-*` discipline checkers. Table stakes; Layer 1 composes
   its primitives (L0.2 → L1.1; L0.4 → L1.3).
2. **Layer 1** — the dissolution lenses, on the Layer-0 base.
3. **The real lens** — a derived projection over the v4 model, once the
   front-end parses `.dag` for real.

The dissolution lens is itself a `fold` over parsed `.dag` — it cannot be
hand-rolled either. It is a *consumer* of the substrate-first sequence,
not a precursor to it.

## 10. Open — audit of current coverage

To be filled: an audit of which Layer-0 checks the v4 compiler enforces
today vs. the gap. The v4 compiler is early-stage (the pipeline is still
being modeled), so Layer 0 is expected to be a substantial current gap —
B1 should state that plainly once audited.
