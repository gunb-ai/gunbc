## Testing Invariants

- **Behavioral only.** Tests assert observable behavior — outputs given
  inputs, error messages, public API contracts. Never assert internal
  implementation details like which private functions were called, what
  order internal steps execute in, or how many times an internal helper
  runs.

- **Source-audit tests are a narrow exception.** When a test
  intentionally reads source text as an architectural ratchet, it must
  anchor on live syntax or declarations and ignore comments or
  historical notes. A comment match is not evidence that a boundary or
  implementation still exists.

- **Hermetic unit tests only.** Tests must not touch the filesystem,
  network, or environment. All external dependencies are injected or
  mocked. A test that passes on one machine must pass on every machine.
  Corpus/integration tests (e.g., `daglang-syntax/tests/item_coverage.rs`)
  that walk the `dsl/` source tree are a recognized exception — they
  live in `tests/` directories and are clearly labeled as non-hermetic.

- **No tautological tests.** A test that mirrors the implementation —
  restating the production code in test form — proves nothing. Tests
  must encode an independent specification of *what* the code should do,
  not *how* it does it. If deleting the test body and replacing it with
  a copy of the production code would still pass, the test is
  tautological.
