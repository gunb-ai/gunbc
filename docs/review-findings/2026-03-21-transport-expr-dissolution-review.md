### 2026-03-21 — transport/expr dissolution review

Fixed:

| # | Violation | Fix |
|---|-----------|-----|
| TD-1 | `LitString` typo in `auth_properties` and `find_property_string` (variant does not exist) | Fixed to `LitStr` (3 sites in `00_core.dag`). Latent — no test breakage because `auth_properties` never called in current test paths. |
| TD-4 | Dead `parent_enum == "Expr"` in `05_emit_rust.dag` variant construction | 7 lines removed. |
| TD-5 | Dead `classify_transport_kind()` in `05_emit.dag`, imported but never called | Function deleted, imports removed from Go/Python emitters. |
| TD-6 | Stale DESIGN.md Layer 2 documented old `TransportBinding` sum type | Updated to Node-based transport model. |
