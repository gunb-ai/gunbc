# FRAME: #15967 packet_G.sh v4 (sha c781341a...), itself #15695 v4a (hardened frame #15931 v12 lineage): die2, scope gate, cgroup
#   bound gates, OOM parser/judge, verdict classifier, completion parser (REAL line verbatim, sha-checked), rc contract,
#   tree_clean, out_reusable, hash_of and their fixtures are copied BYTE FOR BYTE; only the job name in the scope gate and
#   its fixture, and the booked cgroup values, differ. Exit contract: 0 held, 1 deviation from a pre-registered verdict,
#   2 no observation (every refusal, timeout 124, signal >128, OOM, incoherent counter, survivors).
